/**
 * for input of size n
 * Space complexity - space used by input  + extra space the algo is using(Auxiliary space)
 * 
 * Space complexity of recursive program = height of tree - O(n)
 * 
 * 2 type of recursions-
 * a. Linear - F(n) = F(n-1)+F(n-2) eg- fibonacci series
 * 
 * b. Divide and conquer - F(n) = F(n/2)+ C --(also called plug and check) eg- binary search
 * 
 * 
 * 3 recursion formula-
 * a. plug and check - F(n) = F(n/2)+C , where C is constant space
 * b. Masters theorem
 * c. Akra bazzi formula-
