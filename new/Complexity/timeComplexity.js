/**
 * Time Complexity is not the time taken
 * 
 * It is how the time grows wrt to the input size.
 * 
 * Big O =O() // tells the upper bound - means maximum-cannot exceed this no. of operations.
 * 
 * Omega () // lower bound-- atleast these number of operations required
 * 
 * Theta() // Big O === Omega
 * 
 * little o ==> if f= O(g), then g<=O(g) but f= o(g), then f<g --(little(o) f is strictly slower then g)
 * 
 * little omega- loosely lower bound =>
 * Big omega ==> f= omega(g)==> f>=g
 * little omega ==> f= little omega(g)==> f>g
